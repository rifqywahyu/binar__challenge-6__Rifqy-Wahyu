# Challenge 06 FSW Synrgy Farrel Abyansyah

This is the repo for challenge 06 that was assigned to all Synrgy participant including me, Farrel Abyansyah.

In this challenge, we were told to create a backend server using `Express.js` and create a RESTful API that could handle a couple of request and spit out response accordingly.
The server could handle a CRUD request based on the user's authority (superadmin,admin, and user).
